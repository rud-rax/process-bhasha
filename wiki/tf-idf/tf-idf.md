TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It's a numerical statistic used in information retrieval and text mining to measure the importance of a term (word) in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).

TF (Term Frequency) measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. It's calculated by dividing the number of times a term appears in a document by the total number of terms in the document. The idea is that terms that appear more frequently within a document are more important to that document.

IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) measures how unique or rare a term is across all documents in the corpus. It's calculated by taking the logarithm of the total number of documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents containing the term. The purpose of IDF is to reduce the weight of terms that are common across many documents and thus less informative.

TF-IDF is calculated by multiplying the TF of a term by its IDF. This results in a high TF-IDF score for terms that appear frequently in a particular document but rarely in other documents, indicating that they are both relevant and distinctive to that document.

Here's an example to illustrate TF-IDF:

Consider a corpus containing the following three documents:

Document 1: "Machine learning is fascinating."
Document 2: "Machine learning is challenging."
Document 3: "Natural language processing is a subfield of AI."

Let's calculate TF-IDF for the term "machine" in each document:

- Term Frequency (TF):
  - TF("machine", Document 1) = 1/3 = 0.33
  - TF("machine", Document 2) = 1/3 = 0.33
  - TF("machine", Document 3) = 0 (term doesn't appear)

- Document Frequency (DF):
  - DF("machine") = 2 (appears in 2 out of 3 documents)

- Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):
  - IDF("machine") = log(3/2) ≈ 0.41

- TF-IDF:
  - TF-IDF("machine", Document 1) = TF("machine", Document 1) * IDF("machine") ≈ 0.33 * 0.41 ≈ 0.14
  - TF-IDF("machine", Document 2) = TF("machine", Document 2) * IDF("machine") ≈ 0.33 * 0.41 ≈ 0.14
  - TF-IDF("machine", Document 3) = 0 (term doesn't appear)

In this example, "machine" has the same TF-IDF score in Documents 1 and 2 because they have the same TF for "machine" and the IDF is the same for both documents. However, since "machine" doesn't appear in Document 3, its TF-IDF score is 0 for that document.
